					<h2>Why Agile Coach Camp?</h2>
					<h3>4 reasons why you should participate</h3>

					<blockquote>"As a Scrum Master who is passionately interested in coaching teams and making people awesome, 
						I really found the Agile Coach Camp Denmark extremely useful for connecting with peers, engaging with them to create new ideas, 
						get inspired, and at the same time get energized.
						Thanks to the organizers who obviously put a lot of effort in making the camp welcoming and engaging for everyone, 
						and also the participants who were very friendly and showed a great deal of hospitality towards each other. 
						I can confidently and frankly recommend Agile Coach Camp Denmark as I see it as a good investment of time and energy."
