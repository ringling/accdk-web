          <h3>What is agile coach camp?</h3>
          <p>Agile Coach Camp is an unconference using Open Space to bring together people interested in helping software development organizations and their business partners get better at mastering their craft.  A wide variety of topics get explored each Camp.</p>

          <h3>What is the agenda of the conference?</h3>
          Because the agenda of an Open Space meeting is emergent, it is impossible to know exactly what is going to be addressed during the meeting. Every morning the participants pitch topics they would like to host a workshop on “the marketplace”. Often what happens in the workshop is very much a co-creation between the host and the participants. The content of the workshops is created by the people attending in the workshop. – be prepared to be surprised!</p>
